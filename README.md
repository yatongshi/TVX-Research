Graphing a comparison of sessions and engaged sessions by country. The graph validates our assumption from previous data. The countries in English-Speaking countries seem to have a much higher engaged rate compared with other Non-English speaking countries. This could be very likely because the website is not tailored to the user experience in non-English speaking countries. One recommendation is that we can build a feature to auto-translate for the countries that we want to target at.

The Referral and Organic Search provides the highest ranking for both index, which means that they are the most effective ways to convert a potential customer to a user. For the future, we can try to prioritizing on the two channels to obtain the most efficient results.

Graphing the user channel percentage. Looking at the percentage of User Channel, Organic Search plays 44.6% out of all channels, which is a reasonal number. However, the referral rate only accounts for less than 1%. Our priority should be setting up a referral program from our existing customers to increase sales.
